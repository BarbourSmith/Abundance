// // Getting back to old-maslow-create

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
to-do-fix

now:
    - BUG: make sure BOM is getting deleted if molecule gets recomputed/ recompile!
    - bug: possibly replicad's - when atoms are not overlapping but share a vector point they throw an error when fusing 

    - Input name fix must have gotten lost somewhere , redo : BUG BUG ! it's in atom, when it checks for name as a condition to add new AP, if this is changed the way in which delete AP works also needs to change since its all done with names 

    - Q: is bom working in multiple levels or just doing BOM for current active molecule? if inputs change (if molecule is recomputed) it should probably recompile. Should bom recompile after molecule recompute instead of active atom?
    
    - Revise try catch worker error management/ i don't think it's working 
    - Alert error message for molecules not working or failing

    - need to start implementing for UX alerts, (a.e.can't find tag), it's hard to tell when i'm doing something wrong in rendering vs when something is breaking. (this.alert message not working )

    - model some things :S [deckle box, stool] > need to start creating new actions with gitmolecules otherwise it's very hard to model anything.
    
    - Cut layout should separate by height
    - Bug : LEVA input error ? - seems like its wire 
    
mid :
    - our own filtering?
    - multiple atom selection 
    - BUG: if we create multiple inputs without changing the name, they won't show in menu 
    - replicad packing? 
    - fix shortcut button
    - github search needs css help
    - hull (in april? waiting for replicad)
    - tag drop downs for extract tag
    - github topic filter search
    - BOM summary / fix inputs
    - add labels to molecule
    - REDO login/browse to use link/reroute
    - allow filtering of projects
    - nest
    - implement three/drei wireframe?
    - GET request sometimes failing at browsing for projects
    - Face lift for project browse and new project (later)
    - Check on accuracy of draw projection in SVG
    - add missing icons BOM,etc, change maslow icon
    - goUp molecule still not working correctly
    - some places still have JSCAD code // clean up
    - BOM summary when molecule is active , button to download
    - Fix gitmolecule search bar max quota issue
    - Top molecule - choose units of measurement 
    - add thumbnail images for projects

future:

    - Zoom in camera on load to bounding box for renderer
    -  import parts ?
    - make sample project with readme walkthrough or sandbox
    - CSS Overhaul , make global fonts, margins, colors
    - keyboard commands r-e-10

Qs :
  

    Modeling:
        - What is the most efficient modeling strategy for joinery? , make all parts and on assembly cut one that will in turn cut the other?

    Dev:
        - will changing inputs not damage model if modeled objects are not tied by planes. A.E. if a screw is modeled in the center of a face, if the face changes position will the screw not be left in the wrong place since its location wasn't modeled off the face?
        - in an assembly, would it be useful to have a list of the tags it contains and be able to filter them on/off?
