// // Getting back to old-maslow-create

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
to-do-fix

now:

    - model some things :S
    - shortcuts are broken again + need cheat sheet 
    - loft with a list 
    - change loft name and make new hull molecule as placeholder
    - check that rotation of planes is correct 
    - make catch for background click if there's no output to display 
    - fix assemblies (make is3D function work for assemblies)
    - split loft and hull into two different molecules 
    - rendering problems when directly linking to run mode
    - assemblies self deleting sometimes after moving parts several times: havenâ€™t found bug source
    - Cut layout should separate by height
    - Can colors be implemented with tags with three js materials
    - Bug : LEVA input error ?
    - export molecule to Github
    - fix project tags for new project
    - make wire only show if connected to an output
    - separate big wire from little wire
    

mid :
    - BOM summary / fix inputs
    - add labels to molecule
    - REDO login/browse to use link/reroute
    - - allow filtering of projects
    - nest
    - implement three/drei wireframe?
    - extract tag should have dropdown of existing tags
    - GET request sometimes failing at browsing for projects
    - Face lift for project browse and new project (later)
    - Check on accuracy of draw projection in SVG
    - add missing icons BOM,etc, change maslow icon
    - add auto save back
    - goUp molecule still not working collectly
    - some places still have JSCAD code // clean up
    - BOM summary when molecule is active , button to download
    - Fix gitmolecule search bar max quota issue
    - Top molecule - choose units of measurement (Should this be in create new project ? as an extra setting)
    - add thumbnail images for projects

future:

    - Zoom in camera on load to bounding box for renderer
    - make sample project with readme walkthrough or sandbox
    - CSS Overhaul , make global fonts, margins, colors

Qs :

    Modeling:
        - What is the most efficient modeling strategy for joinery? , make all parts and on assembly cut one that will in turn cut the other?

    Dev:
        - will changing inputs not damage model if modeled objects are not tied by planes. A.E. if a screw is modeled in the center of a face, if the face changes position will the screw not be left in the wrong place since its location wasn't modeled off the face?
        - in an assembly, would it be useful to have a list of the tags it contains and be able to filter them on/off?
