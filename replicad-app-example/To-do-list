// // Getting back to old-maslow-create

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
to-do-fix

now:
- still loading wrong inputs for github molecules
 - molecules late rendering, value updating but not sending to update value, maybe need to pass processing flag?
- ran out of battery but close to exporting (use create project func and pass it as prop to export with changes )
    -  PROPAGATION BUG ! (recreate with github molecules in stool )
    - broke input menu for molecules
    - BUG:molecules being sent to render a lot of times, not sure why so they get rendered with the incorrect input values before the values get propagated and updated 
    - make assembly work for sketch, (to fuse sketch together before extruding)
    - need way to label molecule inside project even if you don't plan to export to github
    - everything is duplicating when going to run mode and back 
    - need to start implementing for UX alerts, (a.e.can't find tag), it's hard to tell when i'm doing something wrong in rendering vs when something is breaking.
    - model some things :S
    - autosave!
    - rendering problems when directly linking to run mode
    - Cut layout should separate by height
    - Bug : LEVA input error ? 
    - export molecule to Github
    - fix project tags for new project
    - generate ID function global , fix for cut assemblies ? 
    - keep out


mid :
    - unique id GENERATOR
    - github search needs css help
    - hull (in april? waiting for replicad)
    - tag drop down for all available tags- warning for no tag found
    - BOM summary / fix inputs
    - add labels to molecule
    - REDO login/browse to use link/reroute
    - - allow filtering of projects
    - nest
    - implement three/drei wireframe?
    - extract tag should have dropdown of existing tags
    - GET request sometimes failing at browsing for projects
    - Face lift for project browse and new project (later)
    - Check on accuracy of draw projection in SVG
    - add missing icons BOM,etc, change maslow icon
    - add auto save back
    - goUp molecule still not working collectly
    - some places still have JSCAD code // clean up
    - BOM summary when molecule is active , button to download
    - Fix gitmolecule search bar max quota issue
    - Top molecule - choose units of measurement (Should this be in create new project ? as an extra setting)
    - add thumbnail images for projects

future:

    - Zoom in camera on load to bounding box for renderer
    -  import parts ?
    - make sample project with readme walkthrough or sandbox
    - CSS Overhaul , make global fonts, margins, colors
    - keyboard commands r-e-10

Qs :

    Modeling:
        - What is the most efficient modeling strategy for joinery? , make all parts and on assembly cut one that will in turn cut the other?

    Dev:
        - will changing inputs not damage model if modeled objects are not tied by planes. A.E. if a screw is modeled in the center of a face, if the face changes position will the screw not be left in the wrong place since its location wasn't modeled off the face?
        - in an assembly, would it be useful to have a list of the tags it contains and be able to filter them on/off?
