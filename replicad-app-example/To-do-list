// // Getting back to old-maslow-create

to-do-fix

now:

- model some things :S

- assemblies self deleting sometimes after moving parts several times: haven’t found bug source
- Problems placing connector when there’s github molecules in project
    (need to change order of propagation so that molecule place connector waits for all github molecule connectors to be placed before trying to place git molecule connector?)
- Make it so that you can rename constants
- Delete circle segment size from molecule build
- make load bar for creating new project and disable button while project is being created
- Wireframe visible \_ make on off toggle // maybe implement with drei for more complex wireframe
- Cut layout should separate by height
- how do we make loft work ? Hull
- Can colors be implemented with tags with three js materials
- Bug : LEVA input error ?

mid :

- nest
- extract tag should have dropdown of existing tags
- GET request sometimes failing at browsing for projects
- Face lift for project browse and new project (later)
- Check on accuracy of draw projection in SVG
- add missing icons BOM,etc, change maslow icon
- add auto save back
- goUp molecule still not working collectly
- some places still have JSCAD code // clean up
- BOM summary when molecule is active , button to download
- Fix gitmolecule search bar max quota issue
- Top molecule - choose units of measurement (Should this be in create new project ? as an extra setting)
- add thumbnail images for projects

future:

- Zoom in camera on load to bounding box for renderer
- make sample project with readme walkthrough or sandbox
- CSS Overhaul , make global fonts, margins, colors

Qs :

- will changing inputs not damage model if modeled objects are not tied by planes. A.E. if a screw is modeled in the center of a face, if the face changes position will the screw not be left in the wrong place since its location wasn't modeled off the face?
- in an assembly, would it be useful to have a list of the tags it contains and be able to filter them on/off?
